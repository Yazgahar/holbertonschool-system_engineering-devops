# Application server vs web server
An application server and a web server are both types of servers used in the context of web applications, but they serve different purposes and handle different aspects of the application architecture.


# Web Server
* A web server is a software application or hardware device responsible for serving static content over the HTTP protocol.
* Its primary function is to handle incoming HTTP requests from clients (such as web browsers) and respond with static resources like HTML files, CSS stylesheets, JavaScript files, images, and other media files.
* Web servers are designed to efficiently serve pre-existing files from the filesystem without processing them dynamically.
* Examples of popular web servers include Apache HTTP Server, Nginx, Microsoft Internet Information Services (IIS), and LiteSpeed.


# Application Server
* An application server is a software framework or platform responsible for executing server-side logic and generating dynamic content for web applications.
* Its primary function is to handle complex business logic, interact with databases, integrate with external systems, and generate dynamic content based on client requests.
* Application servers typically support server-side programming languages and frameworks such as Java (e.g., Java EE, Jakarta EE), .NET, PHP, Python, Ruby, Node.js, and others.
* They provide runtime environments and services for executing application code, managing transactions, handling session management, and supporting distributed computing.
* Application servers often work in conjunction with web servers, where the web server handles static content delivery and forwards dynamic requests to the application server for processing.
* Examples of application servers include Apache Tomcat, IBM WebSphere Application Server, Red Hat JBoss, Oracle WebLogic Server, and Microsoft ASP.NET.

# Conclusion
In summary, while both web servers and application servers play crucial roles in web application architecture, they serve different purposes. Web servers primarily handle static content delivery over HTTP, while application servers execute server-side logic, process dynamic requests, and generate dynamic content for web applications. In many cases, they work together to deliver fully functional and dynamic web applications to clients.
